## Problem

During the process of writing software in the team, you develop a certain style and 
define standards that meet the requirements for this software. These standards grow 
into libraries and frameworks. This is my approach based on
[interface-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface-based_programming) and 
[modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming).
